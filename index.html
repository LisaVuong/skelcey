            <p>
                My work is often a reaction to the world around me; things, people, and events manifest themselves through shape and material experimentation, technique, and perserverance. It is driven by exploration of technique and 3D computer modeling and 3D printing processes. I take what shockes, arouses, inspires, and horrifies in the world and create forms that reflect a distortion of these influences into a thoughtful and compelling body of work.

            <h2>The Missing Bees</h2>
            <p>
                Upon getting this assignment of Past | Present | Future one of the first ideas that came to mind was the mystery of the disappearing honeybee. The first thing that you think about a honeybee is that it is the producer of honey. This however is merely the tip of the iceberg. The honeybee is the main pollinator for most vegetables, nuts, and fruit; bees pollinate one third of the nations produce. This disappearance has affected 24 U.S. states already and is also an international problem as well.

                        <h4>Work Caption</h4>
                        <p>
                            The ring was symbolic of the honey product the bee gives us and what we often associate with bees. The brooches went together on an alfalfa brooch with real alfalfa sprouting up and out of it, and a stylized root brooch moving in a downward direction around a honeycomb cell.

                            The bracelet is associated with fruit, the strawberry in particular, through color and form translated well to jewelry form.
